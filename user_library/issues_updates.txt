    #need to make a function that calculates everything the dumb way so that I can compare results and make sure that
    #my algorithm works

    #need to do all 4 things that oliver requested
    #1) synch binvestigate, get new/expanded translation list
    #2) public group names based on counts
    #3) inchikeys based on the mapping that came from the msp - DONE
    #4) somehow handle unknowns. possibly fork the snakemake

    #speedup single result calculator
    #1) should come up with a way for single result calculator to not ahve to declare so much stuff
    #2) avoid triple loc
    #3) if doing "complete space" then can invoke the "species of to starts after species of from" - DONE
    #4) in cases where there is a "two node" graph, we can make the second node a copy of the first - IMPOSSIBLE, cant do, different nodes create different results at least in the "except for" space and possibly elsewhere

    #comment everything

    #handle multiple "except for" conditions in the SingleResultCalculator
    #that is, if there is an except for in species as well as in organ, then there are actually
    #three possible interpretations, where each individual can be except for or multiple can be except for
    
    #some sort of "request converted to data that we actually have" script
    #since we store the minimal splitting tree and people might want more than that

    #come up with actionable interface

    #need to make it so that hardcoded addresses are no longer the case

    #potential upgrade
    #reverse compound hierarchy during snakemake

    #put this shit on github - DONE

    #bug
    #doesnnt seem to work when CHEMONTID is the headnode

    #come up with actionable end-user interface

    #i think the plan should be to make a simple version with very little data and have oliver and crew
    #test it out
    #just make it with a csv
    
    
    #things becoming less relevant as "pre compute" becomes best option
    #put on pypy
    #add multiprocess to all compound evaluator
    #hyperparameters that people could add
    #1) cutoff for threshold
    #2) minimum number of samples in snakemake
    #easy to use translator that converts the mesh codes and ncbi codes to english words
    #1) where to put this
    #2) how to confer understanding of path dependence    
    #should make a basic usage version that "does everything"
    #potential bug
    #I wrote it so that SingleCompoundEvaluator fails if mesh labels are given instead of a mesh path by adding [0] instead
    #of the list itself
    #potential upgrade
    #make it so that the nodelists all connect to the original headnode if the version is chosen based on some 
    #level spread
    #want to make "shrinking the nx" an option in the MainClass
    #need to write a function that minimizes a given nx, then unminimize then in the snakemake
